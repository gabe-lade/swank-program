### Quantifying Threshold Manipulation in the Presence of Rounding: The Case of Lead Monitoring in US Drinking Water
**Authors:** Tihitina Andarge, Dalia Ghanem, David A. Keiser, and Gabriel E. Lade
**Year:** 2025
**Publication:** American Economic Review: Insights
**Link:** [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20240258](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20240258)

When regulations set specific cutoff points there's a risk that people might manipulate test results to just barely pass the threshold. This study develops new statistical methods to detect when results are being deliberately manipulated versus when they simply appear clustered near thresholds due to normal rounding of measurements. We apply our new approach to lead testing data under the Safe Drinking Water Act and find evidence of manipulation in some monitoring results.

### Biofuels: Past, Present, and Future
**Authors:** Gabriel E. Lade and Aaron Smith
**Year:** 2025
**Publication:** Annual Review of Resource Economics, Vol. 17
**Link:** [https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-resource-011724-082950](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-resource-011724-082950)

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed two decades ago, made biofuels a permanent part of America's fuel supply, but the policy has faced ongoing challenges. Early concerns focused on whether biofuels drove up food prices and converted farmland, while failing to make advanced cellulosic ethanol economically viable. Today, the biofuel landscape has shifted toward renewable diesel and state-level policies, with new interest in sustainable aviation fuel, though the old worries about food prices, land use, and the cost of truly low-carbon fuels have resurfaced.

### Size-based Regulation and Water Quality: Evidence from the Iowa Hog Industry
**Authors:** Chen-Ti Chen, Gabriel E. Lade, David Keiser, and John Crespi
**Year:** 2025
**Publication:** American Journal of Agricultural Economics
**Link:** [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajae.70006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajae.70006)

Large-scale hog farms have raised concerns about water pollution, prompting regulations in 2003 that targeted the biggest operations. While these rules successfully reduced ammonia pollution from large Iowa hog farms by 6-8%, pollution increased downstream of mid-sized hog farms that weren't covered by the regulations. The overall impact on water quality in Iowa was probably minimal since mid-sized operations have grown faster than large ones.
