## History {#history}

C. William (Bill) Swank (1931-2019) worked at the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation for over 40 years, including as Executive Vice President from 1968 to 1996. A distinguished alumnus (B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.) of The Ohio State University and an Air Force veteran, Bill recognized early in his career that rural and urban communities are deeply connected and that solving their shared challenges requires thoughtful, objective research. In 1995, the Nationwide Foundation and The Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, along with friends, colleagues, and members of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, established an endowment to create the C. William Swank Chair in Rural-Urban Policy.

Dr. Lawrence Libby became the first holder of the Swank Chair in 1997. His research examined competition for land and water between rural and urban communities, environmental policies affecting agriculture, and the economic performance of natural resource institutions. He led the program until 2005, when he was named Interim Director of the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State.

Dr. Mark Partridge assumed the role of the second Swank Chair in 2005. His research investigated rural-urban interdependence, why some communities grow faster than others, and innovations in regional policy and governance. He published over 100 academic articles during his career, as well as the book "The Geography of American Poverty: Is There a Role for Place-Based Policy?" Under his leadership, the program received funding from prestigious organizations including the National Science Foundation, the World Bank, the US Department of Agriculture, and the Brookings Institution. Dr. Patridge retired in 2024.

Dr. Gabriel E. Lade was appointed as the third Swank Chair in 2025. Dr. Lade's research studies impacts of renewable energy and agri-environmental policy, the value of rural and urban water quality, and land-use management. Dr. Lade takes over as Swank chair, focusing on continuing the program's mission to produce actionable applied economic research on the issues shaping the future of rural and urban communities, while training the next generation of students working on rural-urban economic challenges.

## Mission {#mission}

The goal of the C. William Swank Program in Rural-Urban Policy is to lead a nationally and internationally recognized research, teaching, and outreach program focused on priority issues related to rural and urban communities and their growth.

Led by Professor Gabriel Lade, the Swank Program combines innovative approaches in economic theory and econometrics to create valuable insights for the academic community, stakeholders, policymakers, students, and the public. In turn, the Swank Program will help inform and facilitate teaching and student research at Ohio State and elsewhere.

Current research priority areas include:

1. The quality of rural, exurban, and urban life
2. The economic impacts and effectiveness of agro-environmental and biofuels policies
3. The pattern, pace, and impact of development at the rural-urban fringe

    <p><em>C. William Swank Chair in Rural-Urban Policy</em></p>
    <p>Gabriel E. Lade is Associate Professor and C. William Swank Chair in Rural-Urban Policy in the Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics at The Ohio State University, where he leads the C. William Swank Program in Rural-Urban Policy. The program produces applied economic research to study critical policies shaping the future of rural and urban communities in Ohio, recognizing that these areas are deeply connected and that solving their shared challenges requires thoughtful, evidence-based solutions. Prior to joining Ohio State, Lade served as an associate professor of economics at Macalester College and held faculty positions at Iowa State University, with visiting appointments at Cornell University and the University of Minnesota. He earned his PhD in agricultural and resource economics from the University of California, Davis. His research focuses on environmental, natural resource, and agricultural economics, with particular expertise in agricultural, energy, and land use policies. Through the Swank Program, Lade aims to connect with Ohio's agricultural leaders, policymakers, and community stakeholders to inform practical solutions that support both rural vitality and urban sustainability.</p>

    <p><em>Ph.D. Student</em></p>
    <p>Jingke Wu is a Ph.D. student in AEDE at The Ohio State University. His research interests focus on environmental economics, urban and regional economics, and the intersection of land use, housing markets, and environmental policy. He uses econometric and spatial analysis methods to study the impacts of environmental factors such as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and point source pollution on property values and community well-being. He is skilled in using ArcGIS, ArcPy, and ENVI to analyze both raster and spatial data, using geographic information to assess impacts on regional economic activities. Outside of research, he enjoys hiking and photography.</p>
